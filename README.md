# PerLOG

PerLOG came about as a need for an easy to setup program to log syslog messages on the local network with a web based front end. I had tried others, but they usually required pipes and sockets and other fun to setup. I wanted something easy and straight forward. When I setup a logging server it is a lone VM or real machine that does not require itself to log to the logging system, thus there is no local logging in perlog unles you tell the local syslog to log to the machines IP also.

 

I thought about wrighting this at work, but those apps are not my property and I want the ability to give back to the open-source community, thus I am doing this on my own time.

I hope someone finds this useful, other than me. :-)
